## Schema

### Required

- `as` (String) The AS pattern you want to match, regexp allowed (e.g. `.$` or `_1$`). It's not validated so please be careful!
- `number` (Number) The ACL rule number (0-4294967294); keep in mind that there are no sequence numbers with AS-Path lists. When you want to add a new line between you have to completely remove the ACL!

### Optional

- `action` (String) Set permit for match or deny to negate the rule. Defaults to `"permit"`.
- `description` (String) An optional description for this AS path. Defaults to `""`.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Enable this AS path. Defaults to `true`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) UUID of the AS path.
