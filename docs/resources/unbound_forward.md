# opnsense_unbound_forward (Resource)

Query Forwarding section allows for entering arbitrary nameservers to forward queries to. Can forward queries normally, or over TLS.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Query Forward
resource "opnsense_unbound_forward" "query" {
  domain = "example.lan"
  server_ip = "192.168.1.2"
  server_port = 853
}

// DoT forward
resource "opnsense_unbound_forward" "dot" {
  enabled = false
  type = "dot"

  domain = "example.dev"
  server_ip = "192.168.1.1"
  server_port = 53
  verify_cn = "example.dev"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `domain` (String) If a domain is entered here, queries for this specific domain will be forwarded to the specified server. Set to `""` to forward all queries to the specified server.
- `server_ip` (String) IP address of DNS server to forward all requests.

### Optional

- `enabled` (Boolean) Enable this query forward.  Defaults to `true`.
- `server_port` (Number) Port of DNS server, for usual DNS use `53`, if you use DoT set it to `853`. Defaults to `53`.
- `verify_cn` (String) The Common Name of the DNS server (e.g. `dns.example.com`). This field is required to verify its TLS certificate. DNS-over-TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks unless certificates can be verified. Set to `""` to accept self-signed yet also potentially fraudulent certificates. Must be set when `type` is `dot`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) UUID of the forward.
