# opnsense_firewall_nat_one_to_one (Resource)

1:1 NAT maps a public IP or subnet to an internal private IP or subnet. All traffic to the public address is forwarded to the internal host or network. Unlike port forwarding, it exposes the full internal system, useful for servers behind a firewall. BINAT rules enable bidirectional translation for consistent incoming and outgoing connections.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "opnsense_firewall_nat_one_to_one" "example_one" {
  external_net = "220.110.81.9/32"
  source = {
    net = "10.10.2.9/32"
  }
  description = "Example one"
}


resource "opnsense_firewall_nat_one_to_one" "example_two" {
  enabled = false
  log = true
  external_net = "220.110.81.9/32"
  type = "binat"
  
  source = {
    net = "10.10.2.9/32"
    invert = false
  }
  
  destination = {
    net = "any"
    invert = false
  }

  nat_reflection = "enable"
  categories = [ "8cb36e8e-1d72-480a-8268-bbdaf1ec6ed6" ]
  description = "Example two"
}

resource "opnsense_firewall_nat_one_to_one" "example_three" {
  enabled = true
  log = true
  external_net = "220.110.81.9/32"
  type = "nat"
  
  source = {
    net = "__lan_network" # aliases are only allowed in type nat rules
  }

  nat_reflection = "default"
  description = "Example tree"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `external_net` (String) Enter the external subnet's starting address for the 1:1 mapping or network. This is the address or network the traffic will translate to/from.
- `source` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--source))

### Optional

- `categories` (Set of String) Set of category IDs to apply. Defaults to `[]`.
- `description` (String) Optional description here for your reference (not parsed). Must be between 0 and 255 characters. Must be a character in set `[a-zA-Z0-9 .]`.
- `destination` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--destination))
- `enabled` (Boolean) Enable this firewall NAT rule. Defaults to `true`.
- `interface` (String) Choose which interface this rule applies to. Defaults to `wan`.
- `log` (Boolean) Log packets that are handled by this rule. Defaults to `false`.
- `nat_reflection` (String) NAT reflection mode. One of `default`, `enable`, or `disable`. `default` means OPNsense uses the global firewall NAT reflection setting.
- `sequence` (Number) Specify the order of this NAT rule. Defaults to `1`.
- `type` (String) Select `binat` (default) or `nat` here, when nets are equally sized `binat` is usually the best option. Using `nat` we can also map unequal sized networks. A `binat` rule specifies a bidirectional mapping between an external and internal network and can be used from both ends, `nat` only applies in one direction.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) UUID of the resource.

<a id="nestedatt--source"></a>
### Nested Schema for `source`

Required:

- `net` (String) Enter the internal IP address or CIDR for the 1:1 mapping. Aliases are only allowed in nat, not in binat type!

Optional:

- `invert` (Boolean) Use this option to invert the sense of the match. Defaults to `false`.


<a id="nestedatt--destination"></a>
### Nested Schema for `destination`

Optional:

- `invert` (Boolean) Use this option to invert the sense of the match. Defaults to `false`.
- `net` (String) The 1:1 mapping will only be used for connections to or from the specified destination. Hint: this is usually 'any'. Defaults to `any`.
