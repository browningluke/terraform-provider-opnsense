# OPNsense Provider

~> Please note that this provider is under active development, and makes no
guarantee to be stable. For that reason, it is not currently recommended
to use this provider in any production environment. If a feature is missing,
but is documented in the OPNsense API, please raise an issue on the Github repo
to indicate interest.

The OPNsense provider is used to interact with resources (only) supported by
the OPNsense API. This provider does not, and will not, support resources
not currently supported by the OPNsense API. If required, see if
[dalet-oss/opnsense](https://github.com/dalet-oss/terraform-provider-opnsense)
will support your needs.

The provider needs to be configured with the proper API credentials before it can be used.

## Getting Started

To generate the API key & secret, follow the
[OPNsense docs](https://docs.opnsense.org/development/how-tos/api.html#creating-keys).
These can then be used to configure the provider.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    opnsense = {
      version = "~> x.0"
      source  = "browningluke/opnsense"
    }
  }
}

provider "opnsense" {
  uri = "https://opnsense.example.com"
  api_key = "..."
  api_secret = "..."
}
```
